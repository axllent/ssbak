# Go MySQL Dump

This package is a fork of [aliakseiz/go-mysqldump](https://github.com/aliakseiz/go-mysqldump), created to address an [unresolved issue](https://github.com/aliakseiz/go-mysqldump/issues/2). Despite multiple attempts to contact the developer, no response was received.

The issue affected the ability to perform dumps and restores without enforcing a database deletion, which is an optional feature in SSPak & SSBak.
